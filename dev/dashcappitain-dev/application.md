### 💡 Why Join?
Because coding alone is fun, but coding with great minds is an adventure.  
I’m joining **Netrum** not just to contribute code, but to share ideas, learn new tricks,  
and maybe drop a few bad programming jokes along the way.  

I want to help build tools that feel like magic to users and magic happens when developers work together. ✨
